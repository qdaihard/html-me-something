		<h3>China</h3>

		<p class="country_description">I was born in China. Even though my parents and I left since I was 6, I have made many trips back home to visit my relatives. There are still a lot of Chinese cities that I have not visited though. I always enjoyed going back since the Yuan is weaker and things are comparatively cheap. For example I could have a full meal for just &yen;&nbsp;10 or ~$ 2!</p>

		<h3>France</h3>

		<p class="country_description">In my junior year of college, I spent a semester abroad in Paris. It was one of the most amazing periods in my life. My French improved by leaps and bounds (even though I still did not consider myself as fluent by the time I left!) and I made a lot of good friends there. The food was amazing too but it was slightly more expensive. For example a bagel sandwich could cost around &euro;&nbsp;8.</p>

		<h3>USA</h3>

		<p class="country_description">I came to the US for college. I have been living here for 5 years now. Living here has opened my eyes to a lot of different sides to this vast and complex country. Just like China, I hope to visit more cities and experience the diversity this country has to offer.</p>

		<h3>Australia</h3>

		<p class="country_description">I have visited this sunny continent twice in my life - Perth and Melbourne. The nature there is stunning and the weather is overall fantastic. I love the Australian accent too. Sadly I have not been able to return though I hope to be back someday to visit other parts of the country!</p>
